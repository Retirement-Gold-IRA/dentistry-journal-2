Behind the enamel is the dentin, a tough and elastic material that makes up most of the teeth.The gum, or gums, is the tissue that surrounds the teeth and extends below the gumline. The gums are important for a number of reasons. First, they provide a barrier between the teeth and your mouth. Second, they trap food particles and other substances, helping to prevent bacteria from entering your bloodstream.The teeth are connected to the gums by a series of ligaments and membranes. These structures are called soft tissue and are much more flexible than the teeth or gums. They are important for speech, nutrition and appearance.</p><h2 id="thebasicsoforalhygiene">The basics of oral hygiene</h2><p>To maintain good oral health, you must practice good oral hygiene.
